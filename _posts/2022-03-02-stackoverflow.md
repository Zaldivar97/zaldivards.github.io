Have you ever asked yourself what is the relation between education and salaries in the IT field, is there any incidence? I have.
Nowadays this is very interesting because most of the times a professional degree is often not necessary to reach a developer role in 
the top companies in the world. You, your colleages or me could have different point of views about it. 

But, what the data suggest about this? To going further with this broad question, I used Stackoverflowâ€™s 2017 Annual Developer Survey.
I checked all the available data within the dataset and I came across 3 querstions that I had interesting to answer to answer the
biggest one.

## 1. What is the relation that has the parents' education on the education and salary of the respondents? 

Here you can see the proportion of respondents with their parents having a certain education. 

![First char](/images/stackoverflow2.png)

More than 60% have a professional degree either it is a bachelor's, master's or doctoral. However is interesting to note that 
High school has almost 16% of proportion.  

This is interesting but does not answer our question. Next, the dataset was aggregated by the parents' education to calculate
the respondents' average salaries based on that.

As you can see, the parents' education has a clear relation in the respondents' salaries. The respondents present a higher salary 
when their parents have higher education. However, this means nothing about the respondents' salaries based on their education.

To answer this, the dataset was aggregated by the respondents' education to calculate thei avegare salaries based on it. Let's
check this out:

This is interesting, take a look at the second element in the above chart...top 2 higer salary and no profesional degree!!
As we thought, a professional degree is often not necessary in the IT field. 

Furthermore, we can conclude that the parents' education has an impact on the respondents' education. Take a look at the below chart to make sure of it. 
The number of respondents with higher degrees(except for the Doctoral degree) is bigger than the corresponding number of their parents.
