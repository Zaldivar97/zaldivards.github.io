Hey there! My name is Christian Zaldivar, this is my miniblog. Here I will be sharing some relevant information about Data science and Python development.

### More Information

I'm 25 years old and I'm from El Salvador, yep, the bitcoin country. Currently I'm colaborating in my company as a Data scientist. However, I'm also a Java and Python developer, by the way, those are my favorite programing languages due to their strong oop patterns. 

Data science, I know this field is huge, that's why I'm always learning new stuff related with data analysis, data pipelines and my favorite ones: machine learning and deep learning. In my current company **The DataWay**, my daily tasks are related with time series forecasting, client segmentation, basket analysis, etc.

The following are some algoriths I have used:
- Facebook Prophet
- ARIMA
- Holt-Winter
- LSTM
- Kmeans
- Apriori
- DecisionTree
